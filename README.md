# Heart_Disease_Prediction
We are living in a post modern era and there are tremendous changes happening to our daily routines which make an impact on our health positively and negatively. As a result of these changes various kind of diseases are enormously increased. Especially, heart disease has become more common these days.
The life of people is at a risk. Variation in Blood pressure, sugar, pulse rate etc. can lead to cardiovascular diseases that include narrowed or blocked blood vessels. It may causes Heart failure, Aneurysm, Peripheral artery disease, Heart attack, Stroke and even sudden cardiac arrest. Many forms of heart disease can be detected or diagnosed with different medical tests by considering family medical history and other factors. But, the prediction of heart diseases without doing any medical tests is quite difficult.
The aim of this project is to diagnose different heart diseases and to make all possible precautions to prevent at early stage itself with affordable rate. We follow ‘Data mining’ technique in which attributes are fed in to SVM, Random forest, KNN, and ANN classification Algorithms for the prediction of heart diseases. The preliminary readings and studies obtained from this technique is used to know the possibility of detecting heart diseases at early stage and can be completely cured by proper diagnosis.
